# Revision
Revision (will be) a tool that allows you to automate extraction of voice lines from visual novels to a pre-specified Anki field.
A key use case for this tool is when cards were initially created without voice lines, and you would like to go back and re-add them in. 
This tool will be an extensible framework, allowing users to create their own plugins for unsupported VNs.
